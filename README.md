# Sudoku_Solver
This Java code is an implementation of a Sudoku solver. Sudoku is a popular number puzzle game where you fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids (known as "boxes") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9 without any repetition.

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. The `isSafe` function checks whether it's safe to place a number `num` in a specific cell of the Sudoku grid. It checks if `num` is already present in the current row, current column, or the 3x3 box containing the cell.

2. The `solveSudoku` function is a recursive backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle. It starts by finding an empty cell in the grid (a cell with a value of 0), and then it attempts to place numbers from 1 to 9 in that cell while checking if it's safe to do so using the `isSafe` function. If a valid number is found, it proceeds to the next empty cell and repeats the process. If it reaches a point where no valid number can be placed, it backtracks to the previous cell and tries a different number until a solution is found or determined to be impossible.

3. The `print` function is used to print the Sudoku grid to the console in a readable format.

4. In the `main` function, the program starts by creating a 9x9 Sudoku grid and allows the user to input the initial puzzle. The user enters the values row by row, with 0s indicating empty cells.

5. After inputting the puzzle, the program calls the `solveSudoku` function to attempt to solve the puzzle. If a solution is found, it prints the solved Sudoku grid; otherwise, it informs the user that there is no solution.

6. The program uses the `Scanner` class to take user input and closes the scanner at the end.

This code provides a basic Sudoku solving algorithm that can be used to solve 9x9 Sudoku puzzles and serves as a good starting point for learning about backtracking algorithms and puzzle-solving techniques in Java.
